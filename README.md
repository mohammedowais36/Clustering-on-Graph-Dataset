# Clustering-on-Graph-Dataset
A cluster in a scatter plot is a group of points that follow the same general pattern, it is used as a process to find meaningful structure, explanatory underlying processes, generative features, and groupings inherent in a set of examples. This project involves 2 primitive clustering tasks on a dataset containing movies and actors. In Task 1, kmeans is applied to group similar actors with an additional two cost functions. These two cost functions helpout in determining the ideal k for the algorithm. Same procedure has been followed for Task 2 but in this one, similar movies are grouped together.
